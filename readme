This repository is a sample how bootstrap scripts can be hosted in GitHub and executed in the server.
To achieve this, you will need at least three scripts namely - root.sh, local.sh, main.sh

The scripts will be invoked in the following order:

root.sh
|-- local.sh
|   |-- main.sh
|   |-- (other bootstraps)

Explanation:
- root.sh is a fixed script that downloads local.sh and always executes it, you will need to register it in your crontab at @restart. The scenario is that the server is always stopped and woken up by a schedule and it has to always execute root.sh.
- local.sh acts as an entrypoint where you can add more scripts here to be downloaded, and also you can control its execution
- main.sh is the actual job that you want to be bootstrapped
